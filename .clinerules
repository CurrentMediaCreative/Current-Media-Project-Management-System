# CurrentMedia Project Management System Rules

## Memory Bank

This project uses a Memory Bank to maintain continuity between sessions. At the start of EVERY task, you MUST read ALL of the following files in this order:

1. `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Foundation document that shapes all other files
2. `memory-bank/productContext.md` - Why this project exists and problems it solves
3. `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - System architecture and key technical decisions
4. `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Technologies used and development setup
5. `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current work focus and recent changes
6. `memory-bank/progress.md` - What works and what's left to build

## Project Guidelines

1. **Simplicity First**: Keep the MVP simple and avoid over-engineering
2. **Documentation**: Update the Memory Bank files when making significant changes
3. **Code Quality**: Write clean, maintainable code with appropriate comments
4. **Testing**: Implement tests for critical functionality
5. **Security**: Handle authentication and data securely

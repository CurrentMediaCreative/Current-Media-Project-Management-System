## Overview
This update modifies the ClickUp integration to be strictly read-only, ensuring data integrity and clear separation of concerns between ClickUp and our local project management system.

## Major Changes

### Server-Side
1. ClickUp Service
   - Removed updateTask method

   - Removed getCustomFields method
   - Removed getViews method
   - Added clear documentation about read-only nature
   - All remaining methods are GET-only

2. API Routes
   - Removed PATCH endpoint for tasks
   - All endpoints are now GET-only
   - Added documentation about read-only API

3. Controllers
   - Removed updateTask controller
   - All operations are now read-only
   - Added documentation about read-only operations

### Client-Side
1. ClickUp Service
   - Removed updateTask method
   - Service now only provides getTask and getSubTasks
   - Added documentation about read-only nature

2. Project Tracking
   - Removed ClickUp update logic
   - Status updates only affect local data
   - Added documentation about display-only ClickUp data

### Type System
1. ClickUp Types

   - Removed types suggesting ClickUp modification
   - Added documentation about separation of concerns

## Testing
1. Read Operations (testReadOnlyClickUp.ts)
   - Tests ClickUp data fetching
   - Tests project matching
   - Tests display of ClickUp data
   - Verifies no ClickUp modification attempts

2. Local Operations (testLocalOperations.ts)
   - Tests local project creation
   - Tests local status updates
   - Tests local data modifications
   - Verifies ClickUp data remains unchanged

## Benefits
1. Data Integrity
   - Clear separation between ClickUp and local data
   - No risk of unintended ClickUp modifications
   - Predictable data flow

2. Code Clarity
   - Clear documentation of read-only nature
   - Improved type safety
   - Better separation of concerns

3. Maintainability
   - Simpler integration with ClickUp
   - Easier to test and verify
   - Reduced risk of bugs

## Next Steps
1. Monitor system performance and user feedback
2. Consider additional read-only integrations with ClickUp as needed
3. Keep documentation updated with any future changes

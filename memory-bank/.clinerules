# Current Media Project Management System - Project Intelligence

[Previous content remains the same until the Technical Patterns section]

### Technical Patterns
- Backend data source is ClickUp (managed by Jake)
- Frontend will be custom-built for Current Media's workflow
- Project will be hosted on currentmedia.ca or via direct link
- Consider render.com for hosting the built application

### Storage System Patterns
1. **JSON Storage Structure**
   - All data stored in JSON files in server/data directory
   - Core data files:
     * users.json - User accounts and roles
     * projects.json - Project details and status
     * contractors.json - Contractor information and rates

2. **Storage Operations**
   - Use storage.read<T> for type-safe data reading
   - Use storage.write<T> for type-safe data writing
   - Use storage.initialize for initial file setup
   - Always handle storage operations with try/catch
   - Initialize storage before server startup

3. **Data Access Patterns**
   - Services handle all data access logic
   - Controllers never directly access storage
   - Validate data before storage operations
   - Keep data structures flat when possible
   - Use ISO strings for dates
   - Include audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt)

4. **Error Handling**
   - Use ApiError class for consistent error responses
   - Handle storage operation failures gracefully
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log storage errors for debugging

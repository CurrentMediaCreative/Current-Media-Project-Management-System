# Current Media Project Management System - Project Intelligence

## Project Patterns & Preferences

### Communication Patterns
- Always discuss and agree on solutions before implementation
- Ask questions when creating something not explicitly stated
- Seek user opinion on best approaches
- Break down complex tasks into manageable chunks
- Create a new task context when approaching information limits

### Technical Patterns
- Backend data source is ClickUp (managed by Jake)
- Frontend will be custom-built for Current Media's workflow
- Project will be hosted on currentmedia.ca or via direct link
- Consider render.com for hosting the built application

### Workflow Patterns
- New projects require: Client, Budget, Scope, and Timeframe before proceeding
- Project creation should generate necessary documentation automatically
- Budget tracking should compare estimates vs. actual costs
- System should provide reminders for project milestones and follow-ups
- Final project review/debrief is required

### Documentation Standards
- Keep Memory Bank updated with all significant changes
- Document current state and next steps clearly
- Maintain comprehensive project context
- Update technical decisions and system architecture as they evolve

### Integration Requirements
- New project forms should be emailed to jake@currentmedia.ca
- Budget documents should be attached to projects
- Project Overview/Shot list should be linkable to Google Calendar events
- Consider how to integrate with Wix-based website if needed

## Known Challenges
- Integration with ClickUp for data synchronization
- Balancing automation with flexibility in the workflow
- Creating an intuitive UI that minimizes manual data entry
- Ensuring proper notification/reminder system

This document will evolve as we work together on the project, capturing new patterns, preferences, and project intelligence.

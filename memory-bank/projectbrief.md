# Current Media Project Management System - Project Brief

## Project Overview
The Current Media Project Management System is a custom solution designed to streamline and automate the video production project management workflow for Current Media. The system will integrate with ClickUp (managed by Jake) as the backend data source while providing a custom frontend interface tailored to Current Media's specific workflow needs.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. Create a unified system for tracking and managing video production projects
2. Minimize manual data entry through templated processes
3. Automate documentation generation for new projects
4. Provide clear visibility into project status, budgets, and timelines
5. Implement reminders for critical project milestones and follow-ups
6. Facilitate comparison between estimated and actual project costs
7. Streamline communication between team members

### Key Features
1. **Project Intake Process**
   - Capture essential project information (Client, Budget, Scope, Timeframe)
   - Generate project form to be sent to Jake (jake@currentmedia.ca)
   - Create budget documents automatically based on project parameters
   - Generate Project Overview/Shot list documents

2. **Project Tracking**
   - Display project status and progress
   - Track key milestones and deadlines
   - Provide reminders for upcoming deadlines and tasks
   - Facilitate post-shoot budget reconciliation (estimated vs. actual)

3. **Project Completion**
   - Guide through project review/debrief process
   - Document lessons learned and feedback
   - Archive completed projects appropriately

4. **System Integration**
   - Pull project data from ClickUp
   - Potentially integrate with Google Calendar for shoot day scheduling
   - Provide links to relevant documents within the system

## Technical Requirements
1. Web-based application accessible via login
2. Secure access limited to authorized team members
3. Responsive design for use on various devices
4. Potential hosting on render.com with integration to currentmedia.ca
5. Efficient data synchronization with ClickUp

## Success Criteria
1. Reduction in time spent on project administration
2. Improved accuracy in project documentation
3. Better adherence to project budgets through improved tracking
4. Fewer missed deadlines or follow-ups
5. Streamlined communication between team members
6. Comprehensive project history and data for future reference

## Constraints
1. Must integrate with existing ClickUp workflow managed by Jake
2. Should minimize disruption to current processes while improving efficiency
3. Must be secure and accessible only to authorized team members
4. Should be maintainable and adaptable as workflow needs evolve

## Timeline
To be determined based on development approach and resource availability.

## Stakeholders
- Brayden (Project Owner)
- Melissa (Producer)
- Jake (Editor, ClickUp Manager)
- Current Media team members who will use the system

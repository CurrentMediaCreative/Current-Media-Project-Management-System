# Progress: CurrentMedia Project Management System

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Implementation Phase

We have made significant progress on the CurrentMedia Project Management System development. The project has moved from planning to implementation, with the following progress made:

- ‚úÖ Project requirements defined
- ‚úÖ System architecture designed
- ‚úÖ Technical approach outlined
- ‚úÖ Memory bank documentation established
- ‚úÖ Project structure setup
- ‚úÖ Development environment configuration
- ‚úÖ Core UI components implemented
- ‚úÖ Server-side API routes implemented
- ‚è≥ ClickUp API integration (implemented, needs testing)
- ‚è≥ Document management functionality (implemented, needs testing)

## What Works

The following components have been implemented:

- Project structure and architecture
- Frontend UI components:
  - Layout components (Navbar, Sidebar)
  - Dashboard components
  - Project listing and filtering
  - Project detail view
  - Document management UI
- Backend API endpoints:
  - Authentication routes
  - Project management routes
  - Document management routes
- ClickUp API integration structure

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality

1. **Backend Development**

   - [x] Project structure setup
   - [x] Express server configuration
   - [ ] MongoDB connection (using in-memory storage for now)
   - [x] ClickUp API integration
   - [x] API endpoints for projects
   - [x] Document storage functionality
   - [x] Authentication system

2. **Frontend Development**

   - [x] React application setup
   - [x] Routing configuration
   - [x] Component library setup
   - [x] Dashboard implementation
   - [x] Projects list view
   - [x] Project detail view
   - [x] Document management UI
   - [x] Forms for project creation

3. **Integration**

   - [x] Connect frontend to backend API
   - [x] Implement ClickUp data fetching
   - [ ] Set up data caching mechanism
   - [x] Document upload/download functionality

4. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Configure Render.com for frontend
   - [ ] Configure Render.com for backend
   - [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas (if needed)
   - [ ] Configure environment variables
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Known Issues

As implementation has progressed, we've identified the following issues:

- ClickUp API integration needs proper error handling for rate limiting
- Document storage is currently using local filesystem, which won't work for production deployment
- Authentication is using a simple JWT implementation with mock users
- Frontend and backend need comprehensive testing

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach

- Focus on a simple MVP that integrates with ClickUp API
- Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
- Use familiar technologies to accelerate development

### Current Direction

- Maintain the simplified approach for MVP
- Plan for modular architecture to allow future expansion
- Ensure solid documentation for maintainability

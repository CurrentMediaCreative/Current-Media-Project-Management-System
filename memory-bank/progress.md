# Current Media Project Management System - Progress

## Project Status: Initialization Phase

The Current Media Project Management System is in the initial setup phase. We have established the memory bank with core documentation files and are preparing to set up the basic project structure.

## What Works

As the project is in the initialization phase, no functional components have been implemented yet. The following foundational elements have been completed:

- ✅ Memory bank structure established
- ✅ Project requirements and goals defined
- ✅ System architecture and technical approach outlined
- ✅ Technology stack and development roadmap established

## What's Left to Build

The entire system is yet to be built. The high-level components that need to be implemented include:

### Foundation
- [ ] Project structure setup
- [ ] Git repository initialization
- [ ] Development environment configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

### Frontend
- [ ] React application setup with TypeScript
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Navigation and routing
- [ ] Dashboard layout and components
- [ ] Project intake form
- [ ] Project details view
- [ ] Budget management interface
- [ ] Timeline visualization
- [ ] Notification system

### Backend
- [ ] Node.js/Express application setup
- [ ] MongoDB database configuration
- [ ] API structure and endpoints
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] ClickUp integration
- [ ] Email service integration
- [ ] Document generation
- [ ] Reminder system

### Integration
- [ ] ClickUp API integration
- [ ] Email service setup
- [ ] Google Calendar integration (if required)
- [ ] Document generation templates

### Deployment
- [ ] Hosting environment setup
- [ ] Domain configuration
- [ ] SSL certificate
- [ ] Monitoring and logging

## Current Focus

The current focus is on setting up the project structure and initializing the development environment. This includes:

1. Creating the basic directory structure
2. Setting up the Git repository
3. Configuring the development environment
4. Pushing the initial code to GitHub

## Known Issues

As the project is in the initialization phase, there are no implementation-specific issues yet. However, the following challenges have been identified:

1. **ClickUp Integration**
   - Need to determine the best approach for integrating with ClickUp
   - Need to understand API limitations and authentication requirements

2. **Hosting and Deployment**
   - Need to finalize the approach for hosting the application
   - Need to determine how to integrate with the currentmedia.ca website

3. **Document Generation**
   - Need to understand the structure of existing templates
   - Need to determine how to generate and export documents in the required formats

## Next Milestones

1. **Project Structure Setup** (Target: TBD)
   - Complete basic project structure
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Push to GitHub

2. **Development Environment** (Target: TBD)
   - Set up frontend and backend development environments
   - Configure database connection
   - Implement basic authentication

3. **ClickUp Integration Proof of Concept** (Target: TBD)
   - Research ClickUp API
   - Implement basic data retrieval
   - Design synchronization strategy

4. **Project Intake Form** (Target: TBD)
   - Design form structure
   - Implement frontend components
   - Create backend endpoints
   - Set up email notification

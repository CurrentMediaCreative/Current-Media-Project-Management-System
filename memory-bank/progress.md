## Project Structure Cleanup (COMPLETED)

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Removed unnecessary directories (/components, /pages, /contexts, /services, /utils)
   - Organized into feature-based structure
   - Removed duplicate layouts and components
   - Structure now matches reference image exactly

2. **Feature Organization**
   - /features/auth/ - Login flow and notifications
   - /features/projects/
     * creation/ - Project creation system
     * tracking/ - Project status tracking
     * contractor-management/ - Team management
   - /features/financial/ - Analytics and payments

3. **MVP Enforcement**
   - Added strict MVP rules to .clinerules
   - Added exact reference image structure
   - Implemented validation rules
   - Enforced feature scope lock

## Known Issues

1. **Component Integration**
   - Need to create container component for project creation flow
   - Data sharing between components needs optimization
   - Error handling could be more robust
   - Loading states need to be added

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Some component props need stricter typing
   - Form data types could be more specific
   - API response types need to be defined
   - Error types need to be standardized
   - Consistent type usage across components needed

## Next Steps

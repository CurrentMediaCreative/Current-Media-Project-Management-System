# Current Media Project Management System - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is focused on building a streamlined project management system following the exact structure outlined in our reference flowchart. The system consists of three main components with a clean, efficient dashboard interface.

### Core Components

1. **Project Creation System**
   - Initial Project Info
   - Scope Definition
   - Smart Budget System
     * Analyze Scope
     * Team Suggestions
     * Multiple Scenarios
     * Profit Margin Calculator
   - Contractor Management
     * Send Assignment Emails
     * Track Confirmations
     * Handle Declines
   - Production Overview/Shotlist
   - Send to Jake

2. **Project Tracking**
   - New - Not Sort
   - Pending ClickUp Entry
   - Active in ClickUp
   - Completed - Pending Invoices
   - Archived

3. **Financial Management**
   - Smart Analytics
     * Estimate vs Actual
     * Team Performance
   - Client Payment Tracking
   - Contractor Payment Tracking
   - Profit Analysis

### Dashboard Interface

1. **Simple Login**
   - Basic authentication for single-user access
   - No complex user management needed

2. **Main Dashboard**
   - Clean, efficient overview of all components
   - Quick-access notification area showing:
     * Pending Contractor Confirmations
     * Outstanding Invoices
     * New Projects Prompt
     * ClickUp Updates
   - Easy navigation to main sections

## Recent Changes

- Implemented feature-based organization for project creation components
- Created comprehensive project creation flow with five main steps:
  1. Initial Project Info (basic details, timeline, budget)
  2. Scope Definition (requirements, deliverables, technical specs)
  3. Smart Budget System (scenarios, cost analysis, profit calculation)
  4. Contractor Management (team composition, assignments, tracking)
  5. Production Overview (timeline, team, requirements review)
- Added type definitions for project creation data structures
- Implemented form validation and error handling
- Created reusable UI components for consistent user experience

## Next Steps

Following our mandatory task management process:

1. **Production Overview Component Enhancement**
   Current task status: Ready for implementation
   Implementation steps:
   - Implement Card/CardContent for better visual organization
   - Add section navigation using Tabs and activeSection state
   - Add visual separators between sections using Divider
   - Enhance timeline visualization
   - Improve team overview layout

   Context window usage: 51%
   Recommendation: Continue with current instance

2. **Subsequent Tasks** (in priority order):
   - Enhance Contractor Management
   - Improve Payment Tracking System
   - Complete Project Creation Flow
   - Implement Project Tracking
   - Create Financial Management
   - Develop Dashboard
   - Integration and Testing

All tasks are properly tracked in progress.md under "Next Steps"

2. **Project Tracking Implementation**
   - Build tracking interface components
   - Implement ClickUp synchronization
   - Create status management system
   - Add filtering and sorting capabilities

3. **Financial Management Development**
   - Implement analytics components
   - Create payment tracking interface
   - Build profit analysis tools
   - Add reporting capabilities

## Development Approach

- Focus on simplicity and efficiency
- Build exactly what's shown in the flowchart
- Discuss any potential enhancements before implementation
- Keep the system focused on maximizing productivity

## Active Considerations

### Core Requirements
- System should be simple to use and maintain
- Focus on efficient project management workflow
- Minimize complexity while maximizing utility
- Build for single-user operation

### Integration Points
- ClickUp data synchronization
- Email notifications for contractors
- Budget calculations and tracking
- Project status management

### Enhancement Process
- Any proposed features must be discussed first
- Enhancements should directly improve workflow
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Focus on practical improvements

## Open Questions

1. **Project Creation Flow**
   - How should we handle partial progress saving?
   - What validation should be required before proceeding to next step?
   - How to handle back navigation without losing data?

2. **ClickUp Integration**
   - What is the optimal data sync strategy?
   - How to handle offline/failed sync scenarios?
   - What ClickUp fields map to our project structure?

3. **Contractor System**
   - How to handle multiple declined assignments?
   - What fallback options for unresponsive contractors?
   - How to optimize team composition suggestions?

4. **Budget Analysis**
   - What factors should influence risk assessment?
   - How to calculate optimal profit margins?
   - What metrics are most important for scenario comparison?

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Components
- Initial project information form with validation
- Scope definition interface with requirements management
- Smart budget system with scenario analysis
- Contractor management with email integration
- Production overview with timeline visualization

### In Progress
- Step navigation and progress tracking
- Data persistence between steps
- Form validation improvements
- Error handling enhancements

### Upcoming Work
- Integration testing of full creation flow
- User feedback implementation
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

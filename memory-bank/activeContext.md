# Active Context: CurrentMedia Project Management System

## Current Work Focus

We have progressed from the initial setup phase to the implementation phase of the CurrentMedia Project Management System. The current focus is on:

1. Testing and refining the ClickUp API integration
2. Testing the document management functionality (implementation completed)
3. Preparing for deployment to Render.com
4. Ensuring the frontend and backend work together seamlessly

## Recent Changes

- Fixed ClickUp API integration:

  - Updated the API endpoint URL to use the full URL format (`https://api.clickup.com/api/v2/task/${taskId}?include_subtasks=true`)
  - Added proper headers including `accept: "application/json"`
  - Improved error handling with detailed error information
  - Modified the code to process subtasks directly from the main API response

- Implemented document management functionality:
  - Created three document form components:
    - Project Overview Form for capturing project details
    - Budget Breakdown Form for tracking project budgets
    - Production Breakdown Form for production planning
  - Implemented NewDocument page for creating documents
  - Added routes for document creation with and without project context
  - Updated DocumentsList component to link to document creation
  - Added "New Document" action to sidebar navigation
  - Implemented email mode for sending document data externally
- Implemented core UI components for the frontend:
  - Project header, info, and subtasks components
  - Document list and management components
  - Dashboard metrics and project cards
- Implemented server-side API routes:
  - Authentication routes with JWT
  - Project management routes with ClickUp integration
  - Document management routes with file upload support
- Created environment configuration for development
- Updated memory bank documentation to reflect implementation progress

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Test the integration between frontend and backend components
2. Refine error handling in the ClickUp API integration
3. Test the document creation and attachment functionality
4. Implement form validation for project and document creation
5. Add comprehensive testing for critical components

### Short-term Goals

1. Deploy the application to Render.com
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
3. Implement user feedback from initial testing
4. Consider adding persistent storage if needed

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication Strategy

- Using API key-based authentication for ClickUp API
- Simple JWT-based authentication for the application itself
- Storing ClickUp API credentials in environment variables

### Data Fetching Approach

- Implemented a hybrid approach:
  - Fetching ClickUp data on-demand for real-time updates
  - Storing local projects in memory (will need persistent storage for production)
- Added error handling for API failures

### UI/UX Decisions

- Implemented mobile-first design with responsive components
- Created a clean, minimal interface with Tailwind CSS
  - Added tailwind.config.js with custom theme extensions
  - Configured PostCSS for Tailwind processing
  - Added @tailwindcss/forms plugin for form styling
- Developed card-based layout for project listings
- Implemented dashboard with key metrics prominently displayed
- Added interactive elements for better user experience
- Created form-based document creation with:
  - Intuitive form layouts with clear sections
  - Dynamic form elements (add/remove items in budget and production forms)
  - Responsive design for all form components
  - Email mode for sending document data externally

### Project Structure

- Monorepo structure with client and server directories
- Modular component design for reusability
- Separation of concerns between UI components and data fetching
- Consistent file naming and organization

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Coding Standards

- Using JavaScript with JSX for React components
- Following consistent naming conventions
- Implementing proper error handling
- Writing clean, self-documenting code with comments

### API Design

- RESTful API design principles implemented
- Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- API routes organized by resource type
- Input validation using express-validator

### State Management

- Using React Context for authentication state
- Local component state with useState for UI-specific state
- Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Prop drilling for component-specific data

### Testing Strategy

- Manual testing of critical paths
- Plan to implement:
  - Unit tests for critical business logic
  - Component tests for UI components
  - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Learnings and Project Insights

### ClickUp API

- ClickUp API integration is working with API key authentication
- Implemented proxy middleware to avoid CORS issues
- Successfully mapping ClickUp tasks to our project model
- Need to handle rate limiting and error cases more robustly

### Technical Approach

- Successfully implemented the core functionality
- Keeping the application simple while ensuring it meets requirements
- Implemented document management with three specialized form types
- Created flexible document creation flow that works both with and without project context
- Added email functionality for sending document data externally
- Identified areas for future enhancement:
  - Persistent storage
  - More robust error handling
  - Enhanced filtering and sorting
  - Document templates and versioning

### Project Management

- Iterative development approach is working well
- Regular documentation updates helping maintain project context
- Need to focus on testing before deployment

This active context will be updated regularly as the project progresses to reflect the current state, decisions, and learnings.

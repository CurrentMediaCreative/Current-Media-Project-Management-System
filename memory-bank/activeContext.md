# Current Media Project Management System - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial setup phase. We have established the memory bank with core documentation files to define the project's scope, requirements, and technical approach. The next immediate focus is to set up the basic project structure and begin implementing the foundation components.

### Recent Activities
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined project requirements and goals
- Outlined system architecture and technical approach
- Established technology stack and development roadmap

## Recent Changes

As this is the project initialization, there are no previous versions to compare against. The memory bank has been established with the following core files:
- .clinerules - Project intelligence and patterns
- projectbrief.md - Core requirements and goals
- productContext.md - Problem definition and user experience goals
- systemPatterns.md - System architecture and design patterns
- techContext.md - Technology stack and development approach
- activeContext.md (this file) - Current work focus and next steps
- progress.md - Project status tracking (to be created)

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Create basic project structure following the defined architecture
   - Set up development environment configuration
   - Push to GitHub repository

2. **Frontend Foundation**
   - Set up React application with TypeScript
   - Configure routing and basic navigation
   - Implement authentication foundation
   - Create basic UI shell with responsive layout

3. **Backend Foundation**
   - Set up Node.js/Express application with TypeScript
   - Configure MongoDB connection
   - Implement basic API structure
   - Set up authentication endpoints

4. **ClickUp Integration Research**
   - Explore ClickUp API capabilities and limitations
   - Determine authentication and access requirements
   - Design data synchronization strategy
   - Create proof-of-concept for data retrieval

5. **Project Intake Form**
   - Design form structure and validation rules
   - Implement frontend form components
   - Create backend endpoints for form submission
   - Implement email notification to Jake

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technology Stack Decisions
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript has been selected for its strong typing, component-based architecture, and extensive ecosystem.
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express has been chosen for JavaScript/TypeScript consistency across the stack and efficient API development.
- **Database**: MongoDB has been selected for its flexible schema, which will accommodate evolving data models and integration with ClickUp data.
- **Hosting**: Render.com is being considered for its modern cloud platform capabilities and ease of deployment.

### Integration Approach
- **ClickUp Integration**: Need to determine the optimal approach for integrating with ClickUp, including authentication, data synchronization, and handling API limitations.
- **Email Integration**: Need to select an email service provider for sending project forms to Jake and notifications to team members.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Need to explore options for integrating with Google Calendar for shoot day scheduling.

### User Experience Considerations
- **Authentication**: Need to design a secure but user-friendly authentication system for team members.
- **Form Design**: Project intake form should be intuitive and efficient, minimizing required input while capturing all necessary information.
- **Dashboard Design**: Need to create a dashboard that provides clear visibility into project status and upcoming deadlines.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Hosting Options**: Need to finalize the approach for hosting the application, either as a standalone application or integrated with the currentmedia.ca website.
- **Domain Access**: Need to determine whether to use a subdomain of currentmedia.ca, a custom domain, or a direct link approach.
- **Security**: Need to ensure secure access to the application, limiting it to authorized team members only.

## Open Questions

1. **ClickUp API Access**
   - What level of access is available to the ClickUp API?
   - Are there any rate limits or restrictions to consider?
   - Is there an existing API key or will one need to be created?

2. **User Management**
   - Who will need access to the system?
   - What different roles or permission levels are required?
   - Is there an existing authentication system to integrate with?

3. **Budget Template**
   - What is the structure of the existing Excel budget template?
   - What calculations and formulas need to be preserved?
   - How should budget data be stored and presented in the system?

4. **Project Form Template**
   - What information is currently captured in the Google Docs project form?
   - Are there any specific formatting requirements for the form sent to Jake?
   - What validation rules should be applied to form fields?

5. **Integration Preferences**
   - What is the preferred approach for integrating with the currentmedia.ca website?
   - Is there a preference for how team members access the application?
   - Are there any specific security requirements or concerns?

These questions will be addressed as the project progresses, with decisions documented in this file and other relevant memory bank files.

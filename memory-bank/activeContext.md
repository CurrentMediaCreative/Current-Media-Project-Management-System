# Current Media Project Management System - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has completed the API Routes section of the implementation plan, including name-based project matching, automatic page generation, and ClickUp integration improvements. This foundation enables seamless project management and status synchronization.

### Current Priority: Frontend Components

1. **Website Deployment**
   - ✓ Configured Vite build for subdirectory deployment
   - ✓ Set up client-side routing with base path support
   - ✓ Configured server for subdirectory hosting
   - ✓ Implemented production security measures
   - ✓ SSL/HTTPS already configured on currentmedia.ca
   
   Next steps:
   - Set up document storage system
   - Implement backup procedures
   - Test core features in production

2. **Document Management Infrastructure**
   - Implement clean URL structure (currentmedia.ca/projects/{projectId}/{documentType})
   - Set up secure file upload/download system
   - Configure backup procedures
   - Implement access controls

### Pending UI/UX Improvements

These improvements are planned but temporarily paused while we focus on website integration:

1. **Navigation Updates**
   - Fix hamburger menu routing
   - Implement proper project card interactions
   - Update navigation patterns

2. **Project Management Interface**
   - Enhanced project card interactions
   - Detailed project popup dialog
   - Full project edit view
   - Document management UI

## Recent Changes

- Updated project routes for name-based operations
- Added project existence check endpoint
- Added ClickUp data polling endpoint
- Simplified project creation/update endpoints
- Implemented automatic project page generation
- Enhanced ClickUp task synchronization

## Strategic Decisions

### Website Integration Priority
Decision made to prioritize website integration before expanding features because:
- Helps identify hosting-related issues early
- Ensures proper security measures from the start
- Provides professional document URLs (currentmedia.ca/projects/...)
- Creates solid foundation for future features

### Document Storage Approach
Decided to use currentmedia.ca for document storage instead of external services:
- Provides branded, professional URLs
- Better control over access and security
- Seamless integration with existing systems
- Simplified management and backup procedures

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Components**
   - Create ProjectPage component with local/ClickUp sections
   - Add "Create Local Project" button functionality
   - Update dashboard to show simplified project cards
   - Create ClickUp data popout dialog

2. **Integration Features**
   - Implement name-based matching system in UI
   - Add automatic page creation on project/task creation
   - Handle email notifications for new projects
   - Set up ClickUp polling system

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test project creation flow
   - Verify ClickUp synchronization
   - Validate status updates
   - Check page generation

## Development Approach

- Focus on production readiness
- Ensure secure document handling
- Maintain simple, efficient workflow
- Build for long-term maintainability

## Active Considerations

### Integration Requirements
- Proper build configuration
- Secure file handling
- Clean URL structure
- Backup procedures

### Security Measures
- SSL configuration
- Access control implementation
- Secure file upload/download
- Data protection

### Performance Optimization
- Build process efficiency
- Resource optimization
- Load time improvement
- Caching strategy

## Open Questions

1. **Document Management**
   - How to structure document storage?
   - What backup strategy to implement?
   - How to handle large file uploads?

3. **Security**
   - What access control levels are needed?
   - How to secure document access?
   - What SSL configuration is required?

## Implementation Progress

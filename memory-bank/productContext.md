# Product Context: CurrentMedia Project Management System

## Purpose

The CurrentMedia Project Management System (PMS) exists to provide a centralized, user-friendly interface for managing and tracking CurrentMedia's projects. By integrating with ClickUp (the primary task management tool) and adding document management capabilities, this system creates a comprehensive project management solution tailored to CurrentMedia's specific workflow.

## Problems Solved

1. **Fragmented Project Information**

   - Before: Project data in ClickUp, documents stored separately, no unified view
   - After: Single interface that combines ClickUp data with project documents

2. **Limited Visibility**

   - Before: Difficult to get a quick overview of all active projects and their status
   - After: Dashboard with key metrics and project cards for at-a-glance understanding

3. **Manual Revenue Tracking**

   - Before: Manual calculation of revenue from active and completed projects
   - After: Automated calculation based on project budget fields

4. **Document Management Challenges**

   - Before: Project documents not directly linked to project management system
   - After: Documents can be created and attached directly to specific projects

5. **Inefficient Project Creation**
   - Before: Manual process for creating new projects with multiple steps
   - After: Streamlined forms for project creation with all necessary components

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**

   - Clean, intuitive interface that requires minimal training
   - Focus on essential information without overwhelming users

2. **Efficiency**

   - Quick access to frequently needed information
   - Reduced clicks to navigate between related content

3. **Consistency**

   - Uniform presentation of project data
   - Predictable navigation and interaction patterns

4. **Accessibility**
   - Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go access
   - Clear typography and sufficient contrast for readability
